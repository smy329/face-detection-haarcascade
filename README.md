# Face Detection With Haarcascade

Detecting faces in images using Open CV and Haar Cascades.

This requires Open CV, Python, Haar Cascades training data and suitable OS platform (Mac, Linux or Windows). For specific version please check vendor websites for the latest.

I used Python 2.7.14 on a test machine running Windows 7 Professional (i3 2.1 GHz Arrandale). To determine which version of Python you have installed, type the following on your terminal or command prompt:

python --version

OpenCV 3.4.3 was used with this project, suitable for Python 2.7.14.
